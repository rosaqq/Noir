bot commands (type them in discord chat while bot is running):

#### special commands (Noir will always respond):  
'noir come'-----to bring noir to the current channel (Noir will answer to normal commands)  
'noir leave'----to get him out of the current channel (Noir won't answer to normal commands)  
'noir kill'-----stops Noir (ends the program)

#### normal commands (Noir will only answer if he's in the channel where they were sent):  
**admin only commands:**  
'noir add mod @someone'--adds @someone as a bot mod.  
'noir del mod @someone'--removes @someone as a bot mod.  
**mod and admin commands:** 
'noir status something'--Changes "Playing" status to 'Playing something'  
'noir status none'-------reverts 'Playing' status to none  
**regular user commands:**  
'!ping'----------------try and guess it  
'noir help'------------pretty self-explanatory

#### how to use chatbot:
'@Noir + message' and he will answer.  
He will learn when you talk with him, and the more you chat, the better he gets at speaking.  
Refer to the linked ChatterBot page to learn how it works.
